# Primaverii - List of countries and sanctions

    The sanction list is a list of persons who are currently being sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), a financial intelligence and enforcement agency of the U.S. Treasury Department. Further info of the person is also included if their name is found on the OFAC's SDN List. 

    If an image is not provided when a new entry of sanction is created, Google Custom Search JSON API is employed to look for the first result from Google image search. If such image is not satisfying, please feel free to provide an image manually. 

    The country list shows the nationality of the sanctioned persons and the number of sanctioned persons by country. REST Countries API has been employed to get some basic information of each country such as official country name in their native language and flag image. Statistics of each country produced by CIA World Factbook is also included when avaliable. 

    When a sanctioned person is added to the sanciton list, their nationality will also be added to the country list if it is not on the list yet. Adding, editing or removing the information of any sanctioned person would also amend the country list accordingly. The number of sactions of each country may change,.
