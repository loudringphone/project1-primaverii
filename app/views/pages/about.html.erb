<h1>Welcome to the U.S. Sanction List ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸</h1>

<div class="intro">
    <p>The sanction list is a list of persons who are currently being sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), a financial intelligence and enforcement agency of the U.S. Treasury Department. Further info of the person is also included if their name is found on the OFAC's <strong>SDN List</strong>. </p>

    <p>If an image is not provided when a new entry of sanction is created, <strong>Google Custom Search JSON API</strong> is employed to look for the first result from Google image search. If such image is not satisfying, please feel free to provide an image manually. </p>

    <p>The country list shows the nationality of the sanctioned persons and the number of sanctioned persons by country. <strong>REST Countries API</strong> has been employed to get some basic information of each country such as official country name in their native language and flag image. Statistics of each country produced by <strong>CIA World Factbook</strong> is also included when avaliable. </p>

    <p>When a sanctioned person is added to the sanciton list, their nationality will also be added to the country list if it is not on the list yet. Adding, editing or removing the information of any sanctioned person would also amend the country list accordingly. The number of sactions of each country may change, and the country may even be removed from the list if none of the sanctioned persons belong to that country. </p>

    <p>Understood that countries may have alternative names. Hence a list of alternative names is added. When a new entry is entered or an existing profile is edited using alternative country name, such name would be changed to the common-used name provided that it can be looked up in the list of alternative names. To avoid misunderstanding, each alternative name represents only one country; therefore, if there is more than one entry of the same alternative name, only one would remain and the rest would be deleted automatically.</p>
