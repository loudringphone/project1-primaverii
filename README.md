# Sancbook

This is my 2nd project at General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Course. Although the development time is only about a week, I belive I have created the largest online social media and social networking platform about sanctions in the world. On the platform, users can suggest who to sanction, participate in discussion and send direct messages to other users. Hopefuly one day some government would notice their requests and sanctions strategies can be deployed accordingly.

### Gems and APIs used
---

#### Gon
This gem is used to 

#### Google Custom Search JSON API


#### YouTube Data API

#### Cloudinary
Since I worry the urls of image may expire one day, I use Cloudinary to upload them to my own account.

#### REST Countries
In this project, I didn't plan to let users add countries by themselves to the database but rather countries would be added automatically when users create sanctions. Therefore, I have emploied this API to fetch country information such as their country name, country code, native official name and most importantly piture of their country flag.

#### Countries
As the time of writing this README, the REST Countries is experiencing a down time. As a result, I need a backup solution. This gem is not as good as REST Countries in my opinion as it doesn't have all the information I need, but at least it could give me the alpha-2 code for each country.
